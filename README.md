# Weather Analytics
For this homework assignment, we wrote a library of functions that employed Javascript's built in higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) that would help us analyze some weather data.

The objective of the assignment was to write functions that did not employ any "conventional" loops, like while, for, for-in, for-of, forEach, etc.
